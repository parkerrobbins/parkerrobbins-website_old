I am currently a postbaccalaureate research assistant in the Language Learning Lab at Boston College.

I am currently in the process of applying to graduate programs in linguistics.

I'm interested in morphosyntax (particularly case), language acquisition, experimental syntax and sentence processing, understudied languages, first language acquisition, metalinguistic awareness, grammaticality judgments, and linguistic fieldwork.

Here's my [CV](../assets/parker_robbins_cv.pdf)!

You can get in touch with me at [firstname].[middleinitial].[lastname]@gmail.com.
