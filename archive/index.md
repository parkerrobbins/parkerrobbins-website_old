I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Chicago.

Among other things, I'm interested in formal, experimental, and formal computational approaches to morphosyntax. I am particularly interested in case and agreement, the nominal domain, and (comparative) Germanic morphosyntax &mdash; especially the morphosyntax of Yiddish, which I am currently learning. 

Here's my [CV](../assets/parker_robbins_cv.pdf)!

You can get in touch with me at [firstinitial][lastname]@uchicago.edu.
