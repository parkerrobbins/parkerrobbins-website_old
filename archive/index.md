I am an MA student in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Toronto and planning to begin a PhD program in linguistics in Fall 2022.

Among other things, I'm interested in morphosyntax (particularly case), language acquisition, experimental syntax and sentence processing, understudied languages, first language acquisition, metalinguistic awareness, grammaticality judgments, and linguistic fieldwork.

Here's my [CV](../assets/parker_robbins_cv.pdf)!

You can get in touch with me at [firstname].[middleinitial].[lastname]@gmail.com.

(More content coming soon!)
